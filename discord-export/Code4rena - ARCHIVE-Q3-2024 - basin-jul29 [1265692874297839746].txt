You’re to set it in your env file that you created. Follow the guidelines given in the contest page. All test passed for me.


[07/30/2024 12:52] prapandey031
You mean the env directory, right?


[07/30/2024 12:53] superman_i4g

[07/30/2024 15:02] prapandey031
Basically, the issue was improper download of the requirements. The .env file creation is optional; just have a rpc url for the MAINNET_RPC_URL var in the toml file (either directly or through a .env file).
Make sure the requirements are downloaded and installed properly. 

All tests have passed for me.

[07/30/2024 18:55] seraviz
Started a thread.


[07/30/2024 19:55] deadmanwalking0021
The stable2 lookup table is a contract that allows Stable2.calcReserveAtRatioLiquidity() and Stable2.calcReserveAtRatioSwap() to efficiently retrieve initial estimations for the pool reserve ratios needed to perform operations that retrive the values of each token that can be converted or swapped in a well in order to assist in peg maintenance of the bean stablecoin. The lookup table contains if ladders generated by binary trees for each respective function. The trees were generated by performing simulations on the stableswap curve and marking the price at different points and liquidity levels. The points were then sorted by price and the tree was generated by recursively splitting the data points in halves until the final leaves were reached. In this way the most frequent prices appear at the top of the tree. The lookup table significantly reduces the gas requirements for the Stable2 functions to converge into the correct target token ratios.


[07/30/2024 19:59] gulshn321
Thanks 🙏 got it


[07/30/2024 20:33] brean (pinned)
Wanted to give some more insight on the development of the stable2 Well function: The function is a implementation of the curve stableswap AMM on basin. Infomation can be seen here:  
https://curve.fi/files/stableswap-paper.pdf
https://github.com/curvefi/curve-stablecoin/blob/master/contracts/Stableswap.vy 

`calcLpTokenSupply` uses the same formula as `get_D` in the stableswap.vy (given the reserves, calculate its LP token supply), and 
`calcReserve` uses the same formula as `get_y`  (given a set of reserves, the lp token supply, and index, find the reserves for that index). 

`getRatiosFromPriceLiquidity` and `getRatiosFromPriceSwap` in the lookup table allows us to get the ratio of the pool reserves given a price. Given that there is a size limit for a given contract, the function returns the ratios for the closest highest and lowest price of the input price.  


The methodology to calculate the ratios are: 

`getRatiosFromPriceLiquidity`:
Starting with a base reserve `x_0`, `y_0` 
1) increment/decrement `x_0` by some x step size
2) calculate the price using `calcRate` with the new reserves
3) repeat 1-2 for a range of x. 

`getRatiosFromPriceSwap`, 
Starting with a base reserve x_0, y_0 
0) calc the lp token supply using `calcLPTokenSupply`
1) increment/decrement `x_0` by some step size
2) calculate the y reserve using `calcReserve`
2) calculate the price using `calcRate` with the new reserves. 
3) repeat 1-3 for a range of x.

The rationale for the lookup table was that `calcReserveAtRatioLiquidity` and `calcReserveAtRatioSwap` performs a newtons estimation on chain, which the number of iterations it takes to converge is largely a function of the initial guess and step size. Thus, the lookup table  assists in finding a good value to initialize the newton estimation, which reduces the amount of iterations significantly. 

The logic used to calculate the ratios used can be found in `StableswapCalcRatiosLiqSim.s.sol` and `StableswapCalcRatiosSwapSim.s.sol`.

Has anybody else successfully run test?


[08/02/2024 08:03] nmirchev8
How functions `calcReserveAtRatioLiquidity` and `calcReserveAtRatioSwap` are going to be used? 
Right now they are not being used in `well`


[08/02/2024 08:06] brean
`calcReserveAtRatioLiquidity` and `calcReserveAtRatioSwap` are not used within the well, but are used externally. In Beanstalk's case, they are used in order to calculate the reserve at a certain ratio (through a swap, or adding liquidity).

[08/02/2024 08:11] nmirchev8
Can we see an example of values that we pass for `ratios` param? Do we use the same as `reserves`?


[08/02/2024 08:14] brean (pinned)
Yes, here is an example of where `calcReserveAtRatioSwap` is being used within Beanstalk.

@deadmanwalking Why are we using --ffi flag with forge test commands? why are we using foreign function interface?


[08/02/2024 14:30] deadmanwalking0021
Because some tests require a python script to be run inline, so ffi is needed for these to succeed. For example see `Pump.CapReserves.t.sol` : https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Basin/blob/58ca5971061d7a02fa0fab3ee16297391bcb97e8/test/pumps/Pump.CapReserves.t.sol#L237

Additionally, the ffi tests are mainly with the pump. Stable2 and Well Upgradeable tests do not need to use ffi, if you don't feel comfortable with using the flag.

this is the stableSwap invariant defined by curve: 
https://berkeley-defi.github.io/assets/material/StableSwap.pdf 

The solution was designed for N tokens, but this current stableswap implementation only uses 2 token, which allows for some simplification.

[08/07/2024 10:53] deadmanwalking0021
This refers to `Stable2LUT1.sol` no the interface. On the website it just mentions that the LUT implements the interface.

@deadmanwalking The flow of the tx to the ultimate well implementation contract is routed via 2 proxies? first from minimal proxy (clone) and then from UUPS proxy to the actual implementation?


[08/07/2024 15:43] vikqaz
@deadmanwalking I mean in the clone (bored Well by Aquifer), the address of the implementation (embedded in the bytecode of minimal proxy) is the address of UUPS proxy?


[08/07/2024 16:24] deadmanwalking0021
Correct. Its a chain of proxies so 2 delegatecalls!

@deadmanwalking  @Brean  what is the difference between ratios and reserves in the context of `getScaledReserves`?


[08/08/2024 16:12] nmirchev8
Ratio is price ratio


[08/08/2024 16:59] lavizrap_
so ratio[0] = reserve[0]/reserve[1]?


[08/08/2024 17:09] nmirchev8
The function calculates what the reserves should look like, if we want the stable swap function to behave for those ratios

Check the above resources.
Curve invariant is different from uniswap formula
